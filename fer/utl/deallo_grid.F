* V200:  6/22/89
* V420: 10/95 - deallocate any dynamic lines that were used by this grid
* Linux Port 1/97 *kob* - Added a preprocessor include for tmap_dset.parm
*			  because it needed a preprocessor.
* V510 *sh* 4/00 - deallocation of axes applies to all -- not just dynamic
*       *acm* 3/12 6D Ferret (common uses nferdims in tmap_dims.parm)
