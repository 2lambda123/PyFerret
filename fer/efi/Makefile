# Makefile (for FERRET/fer/efi statically linked EF code)
#
# Feb 28, 2000  -- based on other TMAP external functions makefiles
# Ansley Manke
# Jonathan Callahan (with some help from Joe Sirott)
#
# *acm* 3/23/2000 link  ../common to ferret_cmn  rather than using the
#       link in ef_utility (which may not be present when this is compiled.)
#
#
#  Note that these functions must be decleared in ../ccr/EF_InternalUtil.c
#  Run the perl script in this directory int_dlsym.pl ./ > intcode.c
#  put the resulting lines in three places in EF_InternalUtil.c as
#  noted in the comments at the start of that file.
