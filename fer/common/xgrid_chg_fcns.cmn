* XGRID_CHG_FCNS.CMN - common declaration of "grid changing functions" --
* functions which are capable of delivering results on a grid which is
* differs from the straightforward implications of the input arguments.

* V450:
* V500: 1/99 added gfcn_arg_type in support of string arguments
* V533: 6/01 *sh* added gfcn_rtn_type in support of string functions
*       2/12 *ksm* added E and F dimensions
