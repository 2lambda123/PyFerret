* XRISC - *sh* 2/1/91
* RISC/FORTRAN compiler can't handle CHARACTER*(*) variables used in
* character string concatenations ("//")
* this common declares a buffer with a fixed length string in which to copy
* the CHAR*(*) string

* V5.0 - 8/99 *sh* this buffer is now used throughtout Ferret. When used during
* symbol substitution and grave accent evals on command it limits the
* command line length. So increase the buffer size.
* V530 10/00 - increased to 2048 (should be at least as large as len_cmnd_buf)

	INTEGER     size_rbuff
	PARAMETER ( size_rbuff = 2048 )  ! was 256 pre 8/99

	COMMON/ XRISC / len_rbuff, risc_buff
	CHARACTER  risc_buff*(size_rbuff)
	INTEGER    len_rbuff
