<TITLE>Ferret Demonstration</TITLE>
<P><CITE>
 This tour will introduce the basic capabilities
 of the FERRET program through examples.

 As you continue your tour,
 you'll see exactly the commands that control Ferret.   

The commands will be in capital letters;  FERRET prompts 
for input with the word </CITE>"yes?"<CITE>

Click<STRONG> one time </STRONG> with mouse button one on the small image under the commands to bring up a full-sized image of the plot produced.

<P> Suppose we want to plot values of 1/i for the first 10 integers
 i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10
 We can do that with the following command:</CITE>
<PRE>
yes? PLOT/i=1:10  1/i
</PRE>

<A HREF="images/ferret_tour_p1.gif"><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="images/ferret_tour_i1.gif"></A>


<P><CITE> We can change the aspect ratio of the plot to a more pleasing size and shape and re-draw the plot
</CITE>

<PRE>
yes? SET WINDOW/SIZE=0.5/ASPECT=0.5
yes? PLOT/i=1:10  1/i
</PRE>

<A HREF="images/ferret_tour_p2.gif"><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="images/ferret_tour_i2.gif"></A>

<P><CITE>We can do the plot with marker symbols instead of a smooth curve:
</CITE>

<PRE>
yes? PLOT/i=1:10/SYMBOLS  1/i
</PRE>

<A HREF="images/ferret_tour_p3.gif"><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="images/ferret_tour_i3.gif"></A>

<P><CITE>  
  We can define a new variable, "inverse", and give it a title of our
  choosing.  In this plot we use both custom plot marks and a line and
  we specify the vertical plotting axis range.</CITE>

<PRE>
yes? LET/TITLE="My inverse of I" iinverse = 1/i
yes? PLOT/i=1:10/SYMBOLS=2/LINE/VLIMITS=-1:2:0.25  iinverse
</PRE>
<A HREF="images/ferret_tour_p4.gif"><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="images/ferret_tour_i4.gif"></A>

<P><CITE>We can combine several functions on the same plot
 </CITE>

<PRE>
yes? PLOT/i=1:10   1/i, 1/(i+3), 1/i + 1/(10-i)
</PRE>

<A HREF="images/ferret_tour_p5.gif"><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="images/ferret_tour_i5.gif"></A>

<P><CITE>
  Now  we'll plot all of the preceding graphs again, but in a single window.
  The parts of the window are called "viewports".
  They are named UL (for "upper left"!), LL, LR, and UR.
</CITE>

<PRE>
yes? SET WINDOW/SIZE=.9   ! (bigger 'cause there will be 4 plots)
yes? SET VIEWPORT UL

</PRE>

<A HREF="images/ferret_tour_p6.gif"><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="images/ferret_tour_i6.gif"></A>

  Here we are just playing with simple 2-dimensional mathematical functions.

<P><CITE> Now we'll look at some real world data.

  <P>To begin we inform FERRET of the "data set" of interest using the
  SET DATA command.  The ETOPO120 data set contains the relief of the
  surface of the earth at 120 minute resolution
</CITE>

<PRE>
yes? SET DATA etopo120
</PRE>

<P><CITE>  We can query FERRET for the contents of the data set with the SHOW DATA
  command.  The output of SHOW DATA immediately follows the command, below.
</CITE>

<PRE> 
yes? SHOW DATA

     currently SET data sets:

</PRE>

<P><CITE> What we see is a single variable, "ROSE", and its 4-dimensional limits.
  The letters I,J,K and L refer to its limits along the X,Y,Z, and T axes,
  respectively.  ROSE is a 2-dimensional variable;  it exists in the XY
  (latitude-longitude) plane.

  <P>Lets look at a shaded plot of the earth's relief.
  Since we don't specify any limits the full extent of the data
  will be used.
</CITE>

<PRE>
yes? SHADE ROSE

  The "1" below specifies pen color one (black) for the continents.
  The GO command can run "scripts" to perform a
  wide variety of tasks.  Go scripts are files of ordinary FERRET commands.

  the Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set ("COADS")
</CITE>

</PRE>

<P><CITE>  As you can see there are a number of variables and there are 12 points
  on the time (L) axis.

  Within FERRET "variables" are always defined on "grids";  "grids" are always
  composed of 1 to 4 "axes"; and "axes" are composed of numerous points.

  We can query FERRET to learn more about the grid and axes upon which
  the variable SST is defined using the SHOW GRID command.
  (The output of "SHOW GRID SST" follows the command.)
</CITE>

<PRE>
yes? SHOW GRID SST

    GRID COADS2

<P><CITE>   We can further enquire about the coordinates of axis points by specifying
  which axis and what range of values we are interested in.  For example:
</CITE>

yes? SHOW GRID/L=1:4 SST

</PRE>

<P><CITE>OK.  Now lets use the SHADE command to make a color shaded plot of the
  sea surface temperature at the first time step,  and overlay "filled" 
  continents instead of an outline.
  Notice the regions where there are gaps in the COADS data set
</CITE>

<PRE>
yes? SHADE/L=1 SST
yes? GO fland
</PRE>

<A HREF="images/ferret_tour_p15.gif"><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="images/ferret_tour_i15.gif"></A>

<P><CITE> Just as simply we can look at the air-sea temperature difference.  
</CITE>

<PRE>
yes? SHADE/L=1 AIRT-SST
yes? GO fland        ! overlay "filled" continents
</PRE>

<A HREF="images/ferret_tour_p16.gif"><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="images/ferret_tour_i16.gif"></A>

<P><CITE>  And we can overlay a vector arrow plot of the surface winds, too.
  The combination of high wind speeds and large air-sea temperature
  difference suggests some regions of the worlds oceans where the
  sensible heat exchange may be very large -- for example off the 
  Atlantic coast of North America.
</CITE>

<PRE>
VECTOR/OVERLAY/L=1 UWND, VWND
</PRE>

<A HREF="images/ferret_tour_p17.gif"><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="images/ferret_tour_i17.gif"></A>

<P><CITE>  A thought exercise to the viewer:

 If sensible heat exchange can be computed by the equation
<PRE>  QSENS = COEF * WSPD * (AIRT-SST)</PRE>
 where WSPD is the COADS wind speed and COEF is an arbitrary coefficient
<OL>
<LI> How would you produce a shaded plot of QSENS at L=1 ?
<LI> How would you produce a time series plot for all 12 months at 
a point of your choosing in the North Atlantic ?
</OL>
<P>OK... Lets look at the annual variation of the sea surface temperature
 by displaying the four seasons on a single plot.
</CITE>

<A HREF="images/ferret_tour_p18.gif"><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="images/ferret_tour_i18.gif"></A>

<P><CITE> It's difficult to pick out the differences in the fields, isn't it ?

  <P>FERRET has many ways to help you explore this kind of problem.
  Lets begin by looking at the average over all 12 time steps.
  We do this with the "AVE" transformation applied to the time axis.

  <P>"SHADE/LINE" tells FERRET to overlay contour lines instead of
  putting a color key on the plot.
</CITE>

<PRE>
yes? CANCEL VIEWPORTS
yes? SHADE/LINE SST[L=1:12@AVE]
</PRE>

<A HREF="images/ferret_tour_p19.gif"><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="images/ferret_tour_i19.gif"></A>

<P><CITE> 
  Now lets look at how the first time step differs from this average.
  We'll use a color palette that emphasizes which regions are
  positive and which are negative.

  <P>Notice that the plot is for January.  The northern hemisphere is in
  winter -- hence colder than the annual average.  The opposite is true
  in the southern hemisphere.
</CITE>

<PRE>
yes? SHADE/PALETTE=centered SST[L=1] - SST[L=1:12@AVE]
yes? GO fland
</PRE>

<A HREF="images/ferret_tour_p20.gif"><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="images/ferret_tour_i20.gif"></A>

<P><CITE>  Now lets look at the four seasons as we did before -- but this
  time plotting the anomaly from the annual average field.
  The contour levels were chosen to emphasize the variations.
</CITE>

</PRE>

<A HREF="images/ferret_tour_p21.gif"><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="images/ferret_tour_i21.gif"></A>

<P><CITE> 
  Lets focus our attention at a particular longitude, say, X=180, the
  International Dateline.  We can get an accurate picture of the SST
  changes there by producing a 2-dimensional view along the Y and T axes.
  We will use the SET REGION command to confine ourselves to X=180.

 <P>The time axis of this data set is referred to as a "modulo" axis
  -- that is, the first month follows on after the last in a circular way.  
  So the L=1:48 qualifier
  repeats the data over 4 cycles in time -- emphasizing its modular nature.

<P><CITE>Our plot shows the expected out of phase behavior between north and south.

  Lets summarize the results by averaging separately within the northern

  We can then plot the two time series that result.
