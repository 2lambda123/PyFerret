<h2>
<a NAME="new_features"></a>New Features and Enhancements in Version 
5.41</h2>

<ul>


<li>
<b>New attribute for calendar type in NetCDF descriptor 
files.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> In the $BACKGROUND_RECORD use 
D_CALTYPE&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp; 'NOLEAP'&nbsp; for example, to specify a 
non-standard calendar type for your data.<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>New internal string handling functions:&nbsp; </b>STRLEN, UPCASE, DNCASE,
STRINDEX, STRRINDEX, SUBSTRING, STRCAT and STRFLOAT.<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>New option for continuous color keys</b> FILL/KEY=CONTINUOUS, and 
SHADE/KEY=CONTINUOUS
plot a color key without the lines between the different levels.<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>New option VECTOR/NOKEY</b><br><br></li>

<li>
<b>New option CANCEL AXIS/ALL</b>&nbsp; cancels user-defined axes, and 
restores coordinate storage for irregularly-spaced axes.&nbsp; Also, 
"yes? CANCEL AXIS axisname" cancels an axis and restores the coordinate 
storage used when an irregular axes was defined.<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>Symbols YAXIS_MIN and YAXIS_MAX always defined after a plot is drawn.</b>
Previously these were only defined when /VLIM option was specified on 
the plotting command.  Now they are also defined when auto-scaling is used.
<br><br></li>

</ul>

<h2><a NAME="changes"></a>Changed option in Version 5.41</h2>
<ul><li>
<b>PLOT/SYMBOL=DOT has been temporarily removed.</b>&nbsp; We need to 
resolve some issues regarding metafiles and postscript.  This option 
will be restored in future versions.
<br><br></li></ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="bug_fixes"></a>Bug fixes in Version 5.41</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Installation: Error messages about <i>libXm.so.2: cannot open shared 
object file</i></b>&nbsp; Motif libraries are no longer required, as 
they are linked statically in with the Ferret executable.<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>"**ERROR: illegal data type (float,string,...) for operation:"</b> 
This error message occurred for some graphical operations on expressions 
involving IF--THEN.&nbsp; Fixed.<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>Bug in strides at the IO level</b> which resulted in improper 
wrapping of data (highly visible corruption).&nbsp; Fixed.<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>Ferret hangs when attempting to access invalid DODS URLS</b> Fixed.<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>SET DATA filename</b>&nbsp; finds files with the extension .nc as 
well as .cdf<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>GIF creation now works with TrueColor visuals</b> as well as 
PseudoColor visuals<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>Nested REPEATs involving parentheses </b>were parsed incorrectly. 
Fixed.<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>Bugs/backwards compatibility issues with PPL commands.</b>  Previous 
behavior is restored.  PPL commands make settings that persist 
throughout the Ferret session.  Qualifiers to plot commands have their  
effect only on that command:
<UL>
<li><b>PPL AXLABP</b> settings persist.<br><br></li>
<li><b>PPL AXSET</b> persists; PLOT/AXES=  or SHADE/NOAXES apply only to 
that one command.<br><br></li>
<li><b>PPL LINE</b> settings persist, setting dash characteristics; 
PLOT/DASH settings are only for that plot command<br><br></li>
</UL>
<li>
<b>PLOT/VS/DASH[=]</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; allows dashed lines on PLOT/VS 
plots.<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>SAMPLEXY function</b> did not check for missing data in the (x,y) 
values to sample.<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>Horizontal log plots </b>had wrong pattern of tic marks on the axis.<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>POLYGONS with missing vertices</b> in overlay plots were not treated 
correctly.<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>POLYGON plots now load all the PPLUS memory </b>needed for the plot 
once per polygon call.<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>Overlays on POLYGON plots </b>now work.<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>POLYGON plots over a depth axis </b>work correctly (previously needed 
a workaround where the vertices on the depth axis had to be multiplied 
by -1).<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>Axis label formatting</b> for small negative numbers has been 
corrected.<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>Regridding with @AVE</b> between unlike grids gave wrong results in 
some cases. This is corrected.<br><br></li>

<li>
<b>Overlays having No Valid Data</b> now put this information in the key, 
rather than across the middle of the plot.<br><br></li>

</ul>


<h2>
<a NAME="known_bugs"></a>Known bugs  Version 5.41</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Scaling of Curvilinear Vectors:</b> Vector arrows in curvilinear 
coordinates are not scaled.  We have a fix for this which will be in the
next release.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Support for GIF creation using 24 bit color (TrueColor) visuals</b> 
does not work under Solaris. <br><br></li>
</ul>
