<H2>New Features and Enhancements in Version 5.7</H2>


<UL>

<LI><A NAME="nc_bounds"><B>Implementation of the bounds attribute for coordinate axes, as 
specified in the CF standard. </B><BR> 
See Section 7.1 of the CF standard,
<a href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/CF-1.0.html"> 
http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/CF-1.0.html</A></P>
<P>The coordinates on the axis may be anywhere within the cells defined by the upper and
lower cell bounds.  There is no change to how Ferret uses the upper and lower bounds of of 
axis cells (also known as boxes). They may be listed or otherwise accessed using the 
pseudo-variables XBOXLO, XBHOXH, YBOXLO, etc. <BR><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Ferret reads NetCDF files which have the bounds attribute. For instance, the ncdump
output for a short file might appear as follows:
<PRE>
netcdf irrx {
dimensions:
	XAX = 4 ;
	bnds = 2 ;
variables:
	double XAX(XAX) ;
		XAX:point_spacing = "uneven" ;
		XAX:axis = "X" ;
		XAX:bounds = "XAX_bnds" ;
	double XAX_bnds(XAX, bnds) ;
	float V(XAX) ;
		V:missing_value = -1.e+34f ;
		V:_FillValue = -1.e+34f ;
		V:long_name = "SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE" ;

// global attributes:
		:history = "FERRET V5.60    4-Jun-04" ;
data:

 XAX = 1, 2, 5, 6 ;

 XAX_bnds =
  0., 1.5,
  1.5, 2.5,
  2.5, 5.5,
  5.5, 7. ;

 V = 
  28.20222,
  28.36456,
  28.35381,
  28.2165,
  28.48889,
  28.31556 ;
}
</PRE>
The CF standard allows for axes in a file that may have discontiguous bounds (the upper bound of
one cell is not the same as the lower bound of the next cell). Ferret does not allow such an axis.
When such a file is read, we arbitrarily choose to use the lower bounds throughout, with the upper 
bound of the topmost cell to close the definition.  This way all axes have contiguous upper and 
lower bounds.  A warning message is issued.
</LI><BR><BR>

<LI>A new qualifier DEFINE AXIS/BOUNDS allows us to define an axis from lists of coordinates and
bounds.  The upper bound of each cell must be the same as the lower bound of the next cell.
The coordinates must be inside (or may coincide with) the cell bounds. Spaces are used here
to clarify the pairs of bounds, but are not necessary and do not affect the way the data is read.
<BR><BR>
<B>Examples:</B>
<PRE>
   yes? DEF AXIS/X/BOUNDS xax = \
       {1,2,5,6}, {0.5,1.5, 1.5,2.5, 2.5,5.5, 5.5,6.5}
   yes? DEF AXIS/Z/DEPTH/BOUNDS zax = \
       {0,20,50,75,120}, {0,10, 10,30, 30,60, 60,90, 90,150}
</PRE>
</LI><BR><BR>

<LI>To request that bounds be written for all of the axes of a variable, even for regular axes, 
<PRE>
   yes? SAVE/BOUNDS/file=bnds.nc var
</PRE>
</LI>

<LI>By default, the bounds attribute will be written to NetCDF files for all
irregular axes. Regular axes may also be saved with bounds by specifying SAVE/BOUNDS<BR><BR>
<B>Examples:</B>
<PRE>
   yes? USE climatological_axes
   yes? LET v = L[GT=month_irreg]   ! variable with an irregular axis 
   yes? SAVE/FILE=bnds.nc/L=1:4 v   ! bounds attribute on time axis.
   </PRE>
<P>Note that we no longer need to use the qualifiers /RIGID /LLIMITS= 
to write a file with an irregularly-spaced time axis.  We will be able to append more 
time steps to the file and keep the correct point spacing.
<PRE>
   yes? SAVE/APPEND/FILE=bnds.nc/L=5:6 v 
</PRE>
<P>If there is a gap between time steps in the file and the first time step being
appended, Ferret inserts a void point whose bounds are the upper bound of the last time
in the file, and the lower bound of the first time step being appended.  Append
steps 10:12 to the file, and then look at the variable and its coordinates:

<PRE>
   yes? SAVE/APPEND/FILE=bnds.nc/L=10:12 v

   yes? CANCEL VAR v
   yes? USE bnds.nc
   yes? LIST v, TBOXLO[gt=v], TBOXHI[gt=v], TBOX[gt=v]

             DATA SET: ./bnds.nc
             TIME: 01-JAN      00:00 to 31-DEC      05:49
 Column  1: V is L[GT=MONTH_IRREG]
 Column  2: TBOXLO is TBOXLO (axis MONTH_IRREG1)
 Column  3: TBOXHI is TBOXHI (axis MONTH_IRREG1)
 Column  4: TBOX is TBOX (axis MONTH_IRREG1)
                         V TBOXLO TBOXHI   TBOX 
16-JAN      12 /  1:   1.00    0.0   31.0  31.00
15-FEB      02 /  2:   2.00   31.0   59.2  28.24
15-MAR      17 /  3:   3.00   59.2   90.2  31.00
15-APR      05 /  4:   4.00   90.2  120.2  30.00
15-MAY      17 /  5:   5.00  120.2  151.2  31.00
15-JUN      05 /  6:   6.00  151.2  181.2  30.00
15-AUG      05 /  7:   ....  181.2  273.2  92.00
15-OCT      17 /  8:  10.00  273.2  304.2  31.00
15-NOV      05 /  9:  11.00  304.2  334.2  30.00
15-DEC      17 / 10:  12.00  334.2  365.2  31.00
</PRE>

</LI><BR><BR> 


<P>Time steps appended to this file will have a void point added as in the example
above, if there is a gap between time steps in the file and those being appended.</P>
<P>If appending data to a file which has a regular time axis and no bounds, if there is
a gap between the time steps in the file and those being appended, Ferret has
always written an axis which is irregular and which has large box sizes at the gap.  
Now, Ferret will issue a note suggesting that bounds would define the time axis more 
accurately.
<PRE>
   yes? use coads_climatology  ! Has a regular time axis
   yes? save/l=1:4/clobber/file=b.nc sst[x=180,y=0]

   yes? save/append/L=6:9/file=b.nc sst[x=180,y=0]

 *** NOTE: Appending to NetCDF record axis which has no bounds attribute.
 *** NOTE: This will result in incorrect box sizes on record axis: TIME
 *** NOTE: Write the data initially with the /BOUNDS qualifier</PRE>
 </LI><BR><BR>

<LI>Existing scripts with SAVE/RIGID/HEADING=ENHANCED/LLIMITS still
work and produce files identical to those written by earlier Ferret versions.
</LI><BR><BR>

<LI>Existing files with the edges attribute are correctly read by Ferret.
</LI><BR><BR>

<LI>A qualifier SAVE/EDGES outputs the older edges attribute on all axes for the variable
</LI><BR><BR>
</UL>

<LI><A NAME="set_ax"><B>SET AXIS/CALENDAR= /T0= /UNITS= axisname</B> <BR>
These new qualifiers let us reset axis attributes CALENDAR, T0, and UNITS
for an axis, whether it was part of a NetCDF dataset or defined by the user. These
do not change the coordinates of the axis, but only the attribute and therefore
they will change the way the coordinates are interpreted by Ferret.
<PRE>
    yes? USE myfile.nc
    yes? SHOW axis `var,return=taxis`  ! Say the calendar attribute is incorrect
    yes? SET AXIS/CALENDAR="noleap" TIMEAX</PRE>


SET AXIS/CALENDAR and SET AXIS/T0 are ignored for all except time axes.  T0 is
input in the Ferret format for date strings "dd-mmm-yyyy:00:00:00", with the hours, minutes
and seconds portion optional.  (See the command DEFINE AXIS/T0=).  UNITS are expressed as 
a string and are converted according to the usual rules for Ferret axes, see "axis, units" 
in the Users Guide. 
</LI><BR><BR>

<LI><A NAME="cancel_ax"><B>CANCEL AXIS/DEPTH axisname</B> unsets the DEPTH attribute for a 
Z axis, which may have been set with a positive="down" attribute in a NetCDF file, or with a 
DEFINE AXIS/DEPTH or SET AXIS/DEPTH command. </LI><BR><BR>

<LI><A NAME="return_cal"><B>RETURN=CALENDAR</B> gives access to the calendar attribute 
of an axis</LI><PRE>
   
   yes? USE mydata
   yes? SAY `sst,RETURN=calendar`
    !-> MESSAGE/CONTINUE GREGORIAN
   GREGORIAN
   
   yes? SET AXIS/CALENDAR=julian `sst,RETURN=taxis`
    !-> SET AXIS/CALENDAR=julian T_AX
   
   yes? SHOW AXIS T_AX
    name       axis              # pts   start                end
    T_AX    TIME               648 i   13-JAN-1946 12:00    13-DEC-1999 12:00
   T0 = 01-JAN-1700 00:00:00
   CALENDAR = JULIAN
      Axis span (to cell edges) = 19723
   
   yes? SAY `sst,RETURN=cal`
    !-> MESSAGE/CONTINUE JULIAN
   JULIAN </PRE>  
   
<BR><BR>

<LI><A NAME="all_leap"><B>New calendar, ALL_LEAP</B> or 366_DAY, in which all years have 366 days.  That is,
every year has a leap day on February 29. This calendar definition is one of those defined by the CF standard 
for NetCDF files. <BR><BR>

<LI><A NAME="noleap"><B>365_DAY </B>is now an alternate name for the NOLEAP calendar. <BR><BR>

<LI><A NAME="mode_graticule"><B>MODE GRATICULE </B><BR>
The qualifier /GRATICULE for plot commands was introduced in Ferret v5.6. <B>MODE graticule</B> allows the user
to turn on graticules, and set the line style, making one setting for horizontal and vertical
graticule lines.  This setting applies to all subsequent plots, until another SET MODE graticule
command is made, or CANCEL MODE graticule. The syntax is:</P>

<P><B>SET MODE graticule[:setting]</B><BR><BR>

For example:
<PRE>
   yes? ! turns on thin, black lines for all plots.
   yes? SET MODE grat  
   yes? USE coads_climatology
   yes? VECTOR/L=1 uwnd,vwnd; go fland
<IMG SRC="v57_grat.gif" BORDER="1"> 



   yes? ! Change the setting to dashed lines

   yes? SET MODE grat:dash  
   yes? PLOT/i=1:40 sin(i/6), sin(i/8)
<IMG SRC="v57_gratdash.gif" BORDER="1"> 



   yes? ! Further settings, in parentheses or quotes

   yes? SET MODE grat:(dash,COLOR=red)
   yes? set data etopo20
   yes? shade/pal=greyscale rose
<IMG SRC="v57_reddash.gif" BORDER="1"> 



   yes? ! different settings for large and small tics   

   yes? SET MODE grat:"LARGE(COLOR=blue),SMALL(COLOR=lightblue)"
   yes? USE monthly_navy_winds
   yes? SET REGION/X=180/Y=0/T=1-may-1989:1-may-1992
   yes? PLOT uwnd

<LI><A NAME="date_string"><B>Journal script datestring.jnl </B>returns a date string as a symbol, 
DATE_SYMBOL in the correct format to use in Ferret commands, for instance in defining a time axis.
If no hour, minute, date are given, the script returns a string with only the month, year, and date.
<PRE>
    yes? go datestring 2004 1 1 12 30 22
        DATE_SYMBOL = "1-JAN-2004 12:30:22"
    yes? def sym start_date ($date_symbol)
    
    yes? go datestring 2004 11 1
        DATE_SYMBOL = "1-NOV-2004"
    yes? def sym end_date ($date_symbol)
