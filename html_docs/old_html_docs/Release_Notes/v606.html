<P>Version 6.07 is required for users who wish to install the new Live Access Server software.
It includes Linux 32-bit and 64-bit executables, with statically-linked versions of both. A Solaris 8
version is also included, however it is linked with an older OPeNDAP library. Further Solaris builds
are in the works and will be released shortly.

<H2>Enhancements and Bug fixes in Version 6.07</H2>

<LI>Ferret executables are built with static libraries where possible (linux systems). In particular 
a number of X11 libraries are now loaded as static libraries.<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>Both dynamic and static executables are available for both 32-bit and 64-bit linux systems.<BR><BR></LI>

command. It shows the Ferret memory as seen by SHOW MEMORY, in MegaWords.
