<P><font color="#993333" size="+3"><strong>Ferret v5.81</strong></font></P>
<P><font size="+1">The notes below on libraries still apply, however if you
find you cannot run the linux executables, we are also making a 
<A HREF="linux_static_downloads.html">statically-linked </A>
executable available. This will run on a variety of linux platforms which are 
now available.  The only downside of the static version of Ferret is that it doesn't 
allow access to the external function capabilities.
</font></P>

<P><font color="#993333" size="+3"><strong>Ferret v5.53</strong></font></P>
<P><font size="+1">As of v5.53 of Ferret, our Linux builds are now being down 
  with gcc/g77 v2.96. As such, the external functions distributed with the Ferret 
  binary are also built w/ the same version of gcc/g77. In addition, the termcap 
  library dependency has been replaced with the more widely available curses library.</font></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="+3">Ferret v5.41</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">We</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="+1"> have had reports
that Ferret v5.41, which was built using RedHat Linux 7.1, will
not run under RedHat Linux 7.3. The reason that this happens is
that the dependent shared-object libraries differ between the
two operating systems. The way to get Ferret v5.41 to run on a
RH 7.3 system is to down load the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.pmel.noaa.gov/ferret/pub/linux/RH_linux_v7.1_shared_libs.tar.Z">shared-object
library tar file</A>. This tar file contains the necessary RH
7.1 shared object libraries that are needed to run Ferret on RH
7.3. The strategy is to take the libraries contained in the <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.pmel.noaa.gov/ferret/pub/linux/RH_linux_v7.1_shared_libs.tar.Z">shared
object library tar file,</A> and copy them into a directory, such
as /usr/local/ferret/libs. Then, the /usr/local/ferret/libs library
path should be pointed to when starting up the Ferret executable.
The recommended way to do this is the following:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">rename the ferret executable in /usr/local/ferret/bin
  from ferret to, for example, ferret_executable.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">create a script called &quot;ferret&quot;
  which contains (for sh)</FONT>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Courier New">#!/bin/sh<BR>
  exec /usr/local/ferret/libs/ld-linux.so.2 --library-path /usr/local/ferret/libs
  /usr/local/ferret/bin/ferret_executable $*</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Then, when Ferret users run the &quot;ferret&quot;
command, they will be executing this script, which will also accept
Ferret arguments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">NOTE: This may not proven effective on all
RH 7.3 systems, but we have had reports that this has worked on
some. If this does not work on your RH 7.3 system, please let
us know.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="+3">Ferret v5.40</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">There are several Issues which have come up
in regards to Ferret v5.40 under Linux. This document will try
to address these issues and, if available, provide solutions for
them.</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">One problem is that when starting Ferret
  v5.40, the error message:</FONT>

<FONT SIZE="+1">libraries: libXm.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</FONT></PRE>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">is displayed. The reason this error message
  occurs is that the shared object Motif libraries are not installed
  on the system. The solution is to download and install the motif
  libraries. These are available free of charge at: <A HREF="http://www.openmotif.org/">http://www.openmotif.org/</A></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">When the next version of Ferret is released,
  this will no longer be a problem, as the motif libraries will
  be statically linked.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">We've had reports of Ferret both working and
  not working with the various flavors of Linux other than RedHat.
  Ferret v5.40 was developed under RedHat 7.1 and so retains whatever
  quirks may be associated with that operating system. If you are
  running a Linux version other than RedHat, and you find that
  Ferret will not run, there are two options:</FONT></P>

    <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Build Ferret from source code which is freely
    available; please see the link from the main Downloads page for the source code.</P></P></FONT>
    <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">Run a statically-linked version of Ferret</FONT>
  </OL>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <UL>
      <LI><FONT SIZE="+1">The disadvantage of this second option is
      that it's not possible to use the external function capabilities
