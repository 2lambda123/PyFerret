<P><font size="+1">The Ferret executables built under Linux Red Hat 3 will run on systems 
running linux Red Hat 5 if compatibility libraries are installed. 

<P><font size="+1">If you find you cannot run the linux executables, we are also making a 
<A HREF="linux_static_downloads.html">statically-linked </A>executable available. This will 
run on a variety of linux platforms which are now available.  The only downside of the static 
version of Ferret is that it doesn't allow access to the external function capabilities.

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><font size="+1">We have had reports the Ferret RedHat 9.0 built with gcc/g77 has successfully 
  been installed on SuSe 8.x systems, and also on Fedora Core 3 (FC3). </font></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><font color="#993333" size="+3"><strong>Ferret v5.53 and higher</strong></font></P>
<P><font size="+1">As of v5.53 of Ferret, our RedHat 9 Linux builds are now being 
  down with gcc/g77 v3.2.2. As such, the external functions distributed with the 
  Ferret binary are also built w/ the same version of gcc/g77. In addition, the 
  termcap library dependency has been replaced with the more widely available 
  curses library.</font></P>
