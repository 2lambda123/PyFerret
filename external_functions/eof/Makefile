#  remove refs to ef_utility/*.o  (now in ferret executable)
#
#  ACM  2/2001  debug macros
#  ACM  Jul 2001 Move to statically linked code in fer/efi.  name functions
#                eofspace, eofstat, eoftfunc; with same code as in fer/efi,
#                but with different INCLUDE statements for use in testing
#                as dynamically-linked functions.
