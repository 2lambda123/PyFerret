This is a summary of the routines that had to be changed to add the
new regridding transform g=@XACT to Ferret

wrote do_xact_regrid.F  (starting from do_lin_regrid.F)

wrote xact_regrid_1_axis.F  (starting from lin_regrid_1-axis.F)

ferret.parm:	     add prgrd_xact

xalgebra_data.F:     add alg_regrid_title, alg_regrid_code
			(regrid trans code may be *6 characters)
			(repair initialization of "unspecified" right below)

rqst_regrid.F	     add logic to determine how many source points to request
			given a desired destination range (or full destination
			axis range if unspecified by user)

rcvd_regrid.F	     add logic to determine what destination range it is
			possible to regrid given the available source points

var_title_mod:	     check to see if titles of plots, etc. are nice
		     e.g. (closest index above by 1 pts on X) isn't too nice
		     modify var_title_mod and/or xalgebra_data text as needed
