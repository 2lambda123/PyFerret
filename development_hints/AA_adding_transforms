9/97 *sh*
This is a summary of the routines that had to be changed to add the 4
new transforms @NRDA,NRDB,NRIA,NRIB to FERRET

wrote do_nearest.F  (handles @NRDA, NRDB, NRIA, NRIB)

wrote do_nearest_dist_above.F (for @NRDA) which calls DO_NEAREST
		(ditto for NRDB, NRIA, NRIB)

ferret.parm:	     add trans_nrst_...

interp_stack.parm:   isact_nrst_...

xalgebra_data.f:     add alg_trans_...text/title/num/etc

interp_stack:	     add EXTERNAL DO_NEAREST_...
		     add IF ( isact...   )  CALL ...

offset_ss.f:	     add DATA and check out where this transformation belongs
		     in the program logic

var_title_mod:	     check to see if titles of plots, etc. are nice
		     e.g. (closest index above by 1 pts on X) isn't too nice
		     modify var_title_mod and/or xalgebra_data text as needed

=================================================


8/29/91 *sh*
This is a summary of the routines that need to be changed to add a new filter 
(like @SBX) to FERRET

WRITE:  "do_smth_..." patterned after do_smth_binml.f
	
ferret.parm:	     add trans_smth_...

interp_stack.parm:   isact_smth_...

xalgebra_data.f:     add alg_trans_...text/title/num/etc

get_context_mods:    error message text, only (could be automated ...)

interp_stack:	     add EXTERNAL DO_SMTH_...
		     add IF ( isact...   )  CALL ...

offset_ss.f:	     add DATA and check out where this transformation belongs
		     in the program logic
