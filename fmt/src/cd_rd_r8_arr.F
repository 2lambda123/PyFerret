* revision 0.0 - 2/92
* V6.1 3/08 ACM If the data type is double and we return without converting 
*           the data, we still need to set status to merr_ok.
* V65  *acm* 1/10  Change all netcdf2-style calls and parameter names to 
*                  netcdf3-style calls, which are also consistent with netcdf4.
* V65  *acm* 1/10  Add #ifdef usingDODSf2cUnderscore, for 32-bit linux build
*                  linked with OPeNDAP library.
* V6.74 3/12 *acm* cleanup ifdefs and unnecessary include files

* argument definitions:
*	cdfid	 - netCDF id number for already opened CDF file
*       varid    - variable id in netCDF file
*       start    - start subscript of netCDF variable to return
*       n        - number of values to return
*	dtype    - data type of variable
*       errstr   - identifying string to be printed with error messages
*       dvals    - double precision values returned
*       status   - TMAP library return status
