* Does the indicated variable use the netCDF record dim ?

* Programmer Steve Hankin
* NOAA/PMEL, Seattle, WA - Tropical Modeling and Analysis Program

* revision 0.0 - 6/92
* 15apr94 *kob* Need to initialzie cd_use_recdim in case of error 
*		exit
*
* 2jun94 *kob* initialization of cd_use_recdim needs to be boolean .FALSE
* 		instead of 0
* V500 4/99 *kob*: increase size of vname from32 to 64
* V552 *acm* 5/03   increase vname to 128 chars 
* V65  *acm* 1/10  Change all netcdf2-style calls and parameter names to 
*                  netcdf3-style calls, which are also consistent with netcdf4.
* V65  *acm* 1/10  Add #ifdef usingDODSf2cUnderscore, for 32-bit linux build
*                  linked with OPeNDAP library.
* V674 2/12 *acm* 6D Ferret: use nferdims rather than 4 for dimension indexing

* 2jun94 *kob* changed initialization from 0 to .FALSE.
