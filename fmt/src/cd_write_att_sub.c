	(from cd_write_var_sub.c) -- this routine hides the call to netCDF routine
    NCVPT allowing last minute modifications to the call arguments


    for Ferret interactive data analysis program

    programmer - steve hankin
    NOAA/PMEL, Seattle, WA - Tropical Modeling and Analysis Program

    revision history:
    V533: 6/01 *sh* - original

    v540: 11/01 *kob* - change passed in values for start and count
                        to temp variables which are declared
			compatibly with the passed in types from the 
			fortran routine CD_READ.F.  Once in, need to 
			convert these to the proper type that the 
			netcdf c routines expect.  This may vary from
			o.s. to o.s. depending on what, for example,
			size_t and ptrdiff_t are typdef'd as.  They are
			typedef'd as different things under solaris and 
			compaq Tru64, for example



    compile this with
    cc -c -g -I/opt/local/netcdf-3.4/include cd_write_var_sub.c
