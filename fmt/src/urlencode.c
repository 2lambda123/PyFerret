URL Encoding/Decoding in C
Recently I had the need to encode and decode URL-encoded strings. After doing a 
brief search of what was available, I found that most of the code I was seeing 
wasn't terribly efficient and/or was rather poorly written. I decided to whip 
up my own routines and am sharing them here.

url_encode was edited to send input string and output string as 
arguments and to return the length of the encoded string.
