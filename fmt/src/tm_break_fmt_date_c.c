/* *sh* 2/13/95

 *sh* 1/97 - modified to accept 4-field date used by LLNL: "1992-10-8 0"

break a date of the form yyyy-mm-dd  hh:mm:ss into its component pieces

all fields are integer except seconds which is float

hh:mm:ss are optional (defaulting to 00:00:00) or seconds, alone may be omitted

  compile with
       cc -c -g tm_break_fmt_date_c.c
  on non-ANSI compilers also use:
        -D_NO_PROTO

 *kob* 5/22/95 - need to add an ifdef check for NO_ENTRY_NAME_UNDERSCORES for
                 those machines (like hp) that don't need the underscore 
		 appended at the end of a routine call....
