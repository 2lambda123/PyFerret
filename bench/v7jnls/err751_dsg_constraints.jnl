! err751_dsg_constraints
! Tickets 1953, 1954  Correctly applying constraints
! on PLOT command to DSG dataset plots.

! Ticket 1953. Y constraints on DSG trajectory ribbon-map plots.
! The data was constrained by /Y= but vertical axis had the 
! original full Y range.

use simple_traj_dsg
plot/y=20:25 sst
! axis ends should be 20 and 25
show symbol yaxis*

! Ticket 1954. The second PLOT command with /X= giving degrees
! as Degrees-W returned an error. Should be identical.

use profile_dsg2.nc
plot/x=-122:-119/thick sal
show symbol *axis*

plot/x=122w:119w/thick sal
show symbol *axis*
