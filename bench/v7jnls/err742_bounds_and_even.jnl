! The SHOW GRID couldn't get coordinates for the lon axis
! The first LIST command shows * for longitude range.
! The second LIST command caused a Fortran runtime error and crash

! File has both point_spacing="even" attribute and bounds on the lon 
! axis.  The coordinates/bounds are not equally spaced. So neither 
! the line_start/line_delta nor the line_coordinates were stored.
