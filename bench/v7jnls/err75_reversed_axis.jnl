! err75_z_reversed.jnl
! Issue 1941

! The file has the z-axis reversed, z listed in order 1000, 900, ...
! The file also has 2-D bounds variables in the lon, lat direction
! so grid formation needs to handle the nvert dimension.

! make an identical copy of the file and open both

sp cp data/z_reversed.nc z_copy.nc

! This listing is correct
use z_reversed
list q

! This listing was incorrect, listed q=1,2,3,4,5,6
use z_copy
list q
