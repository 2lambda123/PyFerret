! The parsing previously evaluated ($a) at the time that ($loop) 
! was parsed, and substituted the value "old" then, so that as the 
! loop executed the "say ($a)" always used the original value of "old". 

def sym a old
define sym loop rep/j=1:3 (def sym a \`j\`; show sym a; say (\$a))
($loop)

! How about in a compound command?
def sym a old; let b = 8; show sym a; ($loop)
