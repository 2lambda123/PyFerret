! Line plots in the F direction borrowed some info
! from the T axis in the grid if available.

use 6dfile.nc
show grid u

! give the F axis a date definition different from the T axis
! (not done in general but you could...)
set axis/units=days/t0=1-oct-2000 faxis
show grid u

! 2D plot is ok
shade/i=1/k=1/l=1/e=1 u

set view upper
! Line plot horiz axis had incorrect dates. Should be Oct 2 - 7
plot/i=1/j=1/k=1/l=1/e=1 u

set view lower
! If the variable had no T axis then there was an error (v7.432 - 7.444)
define axis/f=1-jan-1990:1-mar-1990:1/unit=days fday
let a = SIN(_f[gf=fday]/10)
let b = 0.4*cos(_f[gf=fday]/4) - 2
plot a, b
