! 8/2005 (acm) bug 1275  stray characters in data listing 
!   (they are leftovers from the buffer containing the header line, was not reinitialized)
!   Also fix the header line so characters are chopped off less.

let id = {1, 2, 3, 4}
let country = {"US", "US", "XX", "CN"}
let type = {"MOORED BUOY", "MOORED BUOY", "MOORED BUOY", "MOORED BUOY"}

list/i=1:5 id, type, country

list/i=1:5 id, country, type
