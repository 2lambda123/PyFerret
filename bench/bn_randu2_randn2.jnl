! Test randu2 and randn2 with newer random-number algorithm.
! 9/2011 acm
! Note that most of these results will differe from one
! run of the benchmarks to the next.

let xbig = x[i=1:20000:1]
let xx = x[i=1:6:1]

! RANDU2 with seed init via system clock. These should be different
! load the variable to make sure some time has passed on the clock.

! ******** This result may differ with each run of the benchmark scripts
load randu2(xbig,-1)
list/i=1:5 randu2(xbig,-1)
can mem
list/i=1:5 randu2(xbig,-1)

! ******** This result may differ with each run of the benchmark scripts
! RANDU2 with 0 seed to continue from previous seed. These should be different
list randu2(xx,0)
can mem
list randu2(xx,0)

! ******** This result should be consistent with each run of the benchmark scripts
! RANDU2 with user-set seed. These should be duplicates
