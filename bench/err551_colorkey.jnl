! colorkey label bugs


let zero = 0*x[i=1:10]+0*y[j=1:10]
set view ul; shade zero            !This one is labeled correctly.
set view ur; shade 1+zero          !So is this.
set view ll; shade/lev=c zero      !But here colorkey is 1:1 instead of 0:0.

! Here the zero level is labelled as -.3e-08 rather than 0. (linux)
