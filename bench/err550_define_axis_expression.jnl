! err550_define_axis_expression.jnl
! reported by A. Wittenberg.
!  Axes defined from an expression only took the first part of the
!  expression The first two axis defines get it wrong (fix in xeq_define.F)

let a = {1,2,3}
let b = {2,3,4}

def ax/x xax = a/2 + b/2
list x[gx=xax]

def ax/x xax = (a/2) + (b/2)
list x[gx=xax]

def ax/x xax = (a/2 + b/2)
list x[gx=xax]


!  Note (acm)  The older syntax defines the axis correctly

def axis/from_data/x/name=xax a/2 + b/2
list x[gx=xax]
