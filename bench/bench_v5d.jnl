! benchmark for Vis5D external function
! 5/99 ACM


!  Write data to a Vis5D file.  The first argument to the 
!  GO script is the file, arguments 2 through 9 are variable names to be written.
! 7/2007 Funtion doesnt want to write a variable that doesnt have a vertical variation.
!        To get a basic test of the function, make some data on a regularly-spaced xy grid.

 set mode ignore_error

use gt4d011.cdf
def axis/y=1:100:1/units=degrees yax
let tr = temp[gy=yax@asn]
go vis5d_write " " tr
