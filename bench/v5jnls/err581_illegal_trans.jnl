! Ungraceful STOP if we do @VAR on an axis where there is no data

! 6/2018 *acm* This syntax is no longer illegal. This was reporting cases 
! where a multi-axis transformation had been set up but the grid doesn't 
! have the axes. Now, we detect the fact that the grid doesn't have a Z axis, 
! and do the transformation as a 1-D transformation.
