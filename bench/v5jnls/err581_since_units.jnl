! bug 1394: units of months_since_event 
! the "since" causes Ferret to try to parse "event" as a 
! date for time origin.  Change so that if its not a date,
! we just keep the whole units string.
! also increase length of strings in line_units array.

def axis/t=1:3:1/unit="months_since_event" tax
let a = t[gt=tax]
save/clobber/file=a.nc a

can var a
can ax tax
use a
say `a,ret=tunits`
list a
