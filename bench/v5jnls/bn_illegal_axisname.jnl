! Some OPenDAP HDF files have illegal axis names, e.g. with a dot in the name.
! This is a test of using such names, in a redefinition of the axes of the data.
! The file has a variable with axis names COADSX.ILLEGAL, COADSY.ILLEGAL. The axes contain 
! just indices.  The file also has variables NEW.LONGITUDES and NEW.LATITUDES which contain 
! geographic coordinates that we want to substitute for the axes.
