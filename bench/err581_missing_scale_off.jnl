! err581_missing_scale_off.jnl
! ACM 11/8/05
! Bug 491 was not correctly fixed... missing flag was scaled with scale, offset
! attribute values.

! data contains missing value flag of -999 and scale of 0.1 
! Previously this resulted in data values of -99 where should be missing.

use missing_scale_off.nc
say `tt,return=bad`
list tt
