DEFINE AXIS/x=1:15:1 xaxis
let var =  {1,2,3,,,,,,,4,,5,6,7,8}
LET myvar = var[gx=xaxis@asn]

list myvar
list myvar[x=6@fnr:2]

! This caused attempt to load variable at index i = -4
list myvar[x=6@fnr:10]

! Likewise the way @FAV is computed, this caused Ferret
! to try to get data at i=-3
list myvar[x=6@fav:18]
