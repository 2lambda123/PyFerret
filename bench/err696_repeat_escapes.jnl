! Ticket 2376 - parsing error with escaped grave-accent syntax

let a = "seq 1 3"
sp echo \``a`\`

! the escapes were removed on parsing the initial
! command rather than keeping them until individual
! commands parsed within the loop
repeat/i=1:2 (sp echo \``a`\`)

! nested repeats
repeat/k=1:3 (rep/i=1:2 (sp echo \``a`\`))
