! testing ticket 1446

! the presence of a tab preceding the "!" comment caused a parsing error

! the behavior of this even in v69+ today is problematic in that
! it echos an ENDIF statement that should be a plain old skip

IF 0 THEN
  LET a = 12
  IF `a` THEN	! a comment
    say "IF YOU ARE SEEING THIS AN ERROR HAS OCCURED "
  ENDIF
ENDIF
