! Missing levels on SHADE auto-level 

! Fix for bug 801 went too far: shade levels need adjusting
! (and were wrong always for negative levels)

! Here is a simpler example (acm)
set view upper; shade/i=1:10/j=1:10 i*j*0.0034   !levels only go up to 0.003
set view lower; shade/i=1:10/j=1:10 -1*i*j*0.0034  

can view
