! Ticket 2123, mis-labeled color bars when 
! single level is specified with a range of values

use coads_climatology

! Previously this labeled both top and bottom with 20
shade/lev=(20,25,5)/L=1 sst

! These cases were correct, and the reason for the above behavior
shade/lev=(5)/L=1 INT(sst)
shade/lev=(25)/L=1 INT(sst)

! Label upper and lower end of the color bar with the range
fill/lev=(20,30,10)/L=1 sst
