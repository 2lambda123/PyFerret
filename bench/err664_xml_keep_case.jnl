! err664_xml_keep_case.jnl
!
! See bug 1177, xml output should keep the original case of 
! variables and axis names.  Previously xml output upcased
! variable and coordinate axis names.
!
! This dataset has variables and axes in various cases: 
! upper case axis TIME 
! lower case axis zt, variable temp 
! mixed case axes grid_x_T, grid_y_T

!******* Note this is NOT implemented in the V6.65 release ******!
!******* Needs further changes to integrate it with LAS    ******!
