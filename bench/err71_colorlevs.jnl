! And symbols LEV* do not list the levels used.

use co_emac.nc
stat co_emac

! previously there were 25 levels chosen by the automatic 
! method, missing the top one because of roundoff error.
! Thus one cell went unfilled.  The LEV_MIN etc symbols were 
! set to 0 because of inadequate formatting of the tiny numbers.
