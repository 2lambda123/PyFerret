 ! bug 1461: bounds variable is created for netcdf output with upcased axis name,
 !           but cd_write_var looked for it with original lowercase axis name.

SET MODE ignore_error

USE err600_upcase.nc
SAVE/CLOBBER/FILE=b.nc v

! this was the workaround for v6.0. After the fix this works the same as the above
CANCEL MODE upcase
SAVE/CLOBBER/FILE=b.nc v

SET MODE/LAST upcase_output
SET MODE/LAST ignore_error
