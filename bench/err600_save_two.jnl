! Bug 1478: save two variables with the same time axis to a file.
! got error attempt to redefine line; axis TIME doesnt match CDF file
! This was due to upcasing of output axis TIME, which needed to be upcased
! before checking whether record axis of the second variable matched the
! one just written to the output file.

use "a1478.nc"
use "b1478.nc"
save/clobber/file="out.nc" olr[d=1], swdn_toa[d=2]
