! ****** An intro to Discrete Sampling Geometries capabilities in PyFerret/Ferret ******

! ****** April 2020
!
! This session demonstrates:
! * Open and examine the file
! * Subset the feature collection
! * Line plots of the subset
! * Analysis operations on the Features
! * Model/feature comparisons
!
!
! netCDF-CF-DSG datasets
!
! Attributes in the file informs Ferret that this is a Feature Collection
! time series collection organized as a Discrete Sampling Geometries dataset.
! The data is an ERDDAP output, using "save as .ncCF"
!
! We start this exploration with a TimeSeries feature collection.
! The instance dimension maps to the ensemble (E) axis (70 features)
! The observations dimension maps to T, because these are time series.
! The observation variables appear as 2D, with the T length equal to the
! observations dimension of the netCDF file.  The actual array that gets
! stored in memory will not match this -- it is the 1D contiguous ragged
! array.

! The Feature-type is shown as part of the header.  
! Internally Ferret creates a “translation” grid based upon the units and
! coordinate range for each relevant axis of the dataset, which allows the
! gridded coordinate formatting routines to be used for DSG variables.
! The SHOW DATA/FULL command will show the extreme coordinate limits of the
! data set
!    longitude range: 0E to 10W
!    latitude range: 19S to 21N
!    depth range: 1 to 1.5
!    time range: 15-JAN-2017 12:00 to 21-APR-2017 12:00

! Graphics
! Each feature type has a native plot type “PLOT VAR”
! will plot the variable in the currently selected set of features.
!
! First lets make a map showing the locations and names of the stations.
! This is nothin nothing new, draw a map and overlay the locations with PLOT/VS

go basemap x=140:360 y=-40:40 20
PLOT/VS/over/nolabel/color=blue/symbol=19/siz=0.2/thick longitude, latitude

! ********************************************************************

set window/clear/siz=0.4/asp=0.6

! Now plot all of the time series in the collection at once.
! Since the plot will have so many time series lines, we choose
! not to make a key; just 70 blue lines.
! Ferret knows these are time series, and it understands DSG coordinates
! internally, much as it would understand gridded coordinates.  So the
! plot is properly formatted and self-describing.

plot/color=blue/line/nokey t_25

! ********************************************************************

! Constraints
! PyFerret standard world coordinate limits qualifiers, X, Y, Z, T and E
! work much as they would with a gridded dataset -- i.e. they control the
! region displayed by the graphics and the data that gets plotted or listed.
! This plot has fewer lines, so automatically give each one a new color or
! style. The legend labels are the profile station IDs from the file.

PLOT/thick t_25[x=130e:170e,y=8s:5n,T=1-FEB-2017:15-APR-2017]

! or equivalently, PLOT/THICK/x=130e:170e/y=8s:5n/T=1-FEB-2017:15-APR-2017 T_25

! Masking
! To select features (individual time series, profiles or trajectories)
! define a feature-mask. 
! SET DATA/FMASK= applies the mask to the dataset until it is cancelled. 
! A listing shows what mask is in place, and lists the data selected.
! We have also constrained in time to make a shorter listing.

let wmo_mask = IF wmo_platform_code EQ 51011 \
     OR wmo_platform_code EQ 52313 then 1

! Other Feature-types:

! Profiles
! Profile datasets, like timeseries, are drawn as lines of data at a
! collection of stations. The legend labels are the profile station ID’s
! from the file. Subsetting and masking is done in the same way as for 
! timeseries data.

! Another plot style uses the RIBBON/VS plot command, with 3 arguments: the 
! locations in two directions, and the variable to use for color. Time on the 
! horizontal axis will result in a formatted time axis. Or specify Longitude 
! or latitude on the horizontal axis.

! Trajectories
! Trajectory data has longitude, latitude, time and measurements along
! the trajectory paths.  The native plot type is a ribbon plot, location
! colored by measurement.  The PLOT command automatically draws a ribbon
! plot.  The usual plot qualifiers apply, setting color levels, palette,
! and so on.

! Or, color by the trajectory ID, so that each one has a color. If there
! are few enough trajectories, the ID's are labeled along the colorbar.

! Working with trajectory data as time series
! For each observation along a trajectory we have a time coordinate
! as well as longitude and latitude. This means the data can be viewed
! as a set of time series. Change to a timeseries view with USE/FEATURETYPE.
! This can be applied when first opening the data or on an open dataset.

! Changing gears now, from graphics to some of the analysis we might
! do with any dataset.

! User-defined variables
! Standard LET syntax works on DSG variables with only subtle differences.  
! For instance, transformations apply within each feature, not over the whole region.
!
! Returning to our timeseries dataset, compute the maximum temperature reached
! and the number of valid data in each time series during Jan-March of 2017

use dsg_pmelTao5daySst_timeseries

LET t_max = t_25[T=1-JAN-2017:31-Mar-2017@MAX]
LET t_ngood = t_25[T=1-JAN-2017:31-MAR-2017@NGD]

! DSG data differencing with model or other gridded data
!
! To sample data from the model grid, define a regridding operation,
! G= to "regrid" a variable on a rectangular grid onto the coordinate
! collection implied by a Discrete Sampling Geometry, the locations and 
! times of the station data.

! Open an NCEP reanalysis dataset and compare the potential temperature
! data with the TAO buoy Timeseries data.
