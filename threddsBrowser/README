This is an Eclipse Java project directory, thus the reason for
the .classpath and .project files, and .settings directory.
The Makefile was created to mimic the standard Eclipse build,
thus the reason for the separate src and bin directory trees.

To successfully create threddsBrowser.jar using Makefile,
the environment variable JAVA_HOME needs to be defined as
the location of a Java 6 Development Kit.

Also, the toolsUI jar file given by TOOLSUI_JAR in
Makefile needs to be present.  The latest release version
of the toolsUI jar file can be downloaded from
    http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/

The resulting threddsBrowser.jar as well as the toolsUI
jar file need to be put into the $FER_LIBS directory (or
the $FER_DIR/lib directory for older versions of ferret).
The toolsUI jar file is accessed using the name toolsUI.jar,
so, if not already given by this name, add a symbolic link
named toolsUI.jar pointing to the actual toolsUI jar file:
    ln -s <actual_name> toolsUI.jar
