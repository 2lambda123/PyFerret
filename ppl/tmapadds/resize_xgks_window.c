 * More hacks to support batch mode (i.e. no display available) *js* 8.97
 * Prevent null pointer dereference for ws if no X display available *js* 2.99
 */

/* Remove XCheckWindowEvent to see if that's causing the occasional hangs

 * *acm* 8/27/04
 * Return ix and iy, the size of the window in pixels.  This will be saved
 * in common so that in gif and batch modes we can return them in symbols
 * PPL$XPIXEL and PPL$YPIXEL.
