   This intermediate "envelope" routine provides the global pointer
   to the PLOT+ memory buffer "X". If the current buffer size is too
   small this routine ensures that it gets enlarged. The final act is 
   to call the PLOT+ PPLLDC routine -- the original arguments are simply 
   passed through, with a new argument: the PPLUS memory buffer

*	SUBROUTINE PPLLDC(K,Z,MX,MY,IMN,IMX,JMN,JMX,
*		PI,PJ,NX1,NY1,XMIN1,YMIN1,DX1,DY1)
*	REAL PI(*),PJ(*),Z(MX,MY)
