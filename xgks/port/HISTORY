VERSION		COMMENTS

1.4.1	1993-3-27
		Undid 1.4 modification because the library-build rule would
		fail on platforms where autoconf set RANLIB to `@:'.

		Quoted all define() first arguments in file `aclocal.m4' so
		that it can be read twice by m4(1) (useful because when 
		autoconf(1) is executed in this directory, it effectively
		reads `aclocal.m4' twice).

		Placed under CVS control.

		Corrected UC_CPP_X11 so that it won't generate `-I-I...'.

		Added test for OSF operating system.

		Added CPP_LDM and LD_LDM to missing values checklist.

1.4	1993-3-5

		Modified library creation rules so that nothing is done if
		LIBOBJS is empty.

1.3.4	1993-3-1

		Modified local autoconf(1) support file`aclocal.m4': added
		self-lockouts to UC_LIMITS and UC_FLOAT and UC_PROG_CC
		requirement.

		Modified method in master makefile, `master.mk.in', for
		producing .f file from .F file.  Now uses symbolic link to
		.c file.  Necessary because SunOS `acc -E' doesn't handle
		.F files and SunOS `cpp' gets wrong header files.

		Removed extraneous message about checking for <limits.h>
		from autoconf(1) macro-support file, aclocal.h.

1.3.3	1993-2-24

		Added modification of existing symbolic link to `ftp'
		target.

1.3.2	1993-2-23

		Changed rule for making a program in the master makefile.
		Now, the C compiler only uses $(CFLAGS) and the FORTRAN 
		compiler only uses $(FFLAGS): the $(LDFLAGS) reference has
		been removed.  This accomodates compilers that don't pass
		unknown options to the loader.

		Added `config' to `clean' target.

		Added `aclocal.m4' to MANIFEST so users can play with the
		autoconf(1)-generated configure script.

1.3.1	Tuesday, February 9, 1993

		Added dependency on library to `program' target.

1.3

		Changed `tar.Z' target: the top-level directory will now be
		the package name suffixed with the version number (e.g
		`udunits-1.5/README').

		Removed `configure' targets from Makefile.in and
		fortc/Makefile.in to comply with autoconf(1) 1.3.

1.2

		Added `SUBDIR_TARGETS = fortc/all' to Makefile.in so that
		it knows how to make `fortc/all'.

		Changed the way the operating-system is discovered from
		relying on file /etc/motd to testing for predefined C
		preprocessing macros.  This is more robust in the face of
		changes to the /etc/motd file at the expense of being less
		encompasing (I only know about the predefined macros of AIX,
		HPUX, IRIX, SunOS, and ULTRIX).

1.1.1

		Added HISTORY (this file) to the distribution.

		Changed procedure for discovering operating-system to use
		sed(1) rather than awk(1).

		Dropped the `lib' from `fortclib.{h,fc}'.

1.1

		Ported to HPUX.

1.0

		Initial release.  Tested on AIX, IRIX, SunOS, ULTRIX.
