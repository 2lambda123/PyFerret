# If you are installing FERRET for the first time at your site we ask
# that you please notify us as outlined in the Ferret Installation Guide.
# Note the suggested ways to contact us and to get support, listed on the
# Support page under the Ferret Web page http://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/
#
# Modify this to suit your system and place the result as file `ferret_paths'
# in another directory set up to hold login initialization scripts.
# `/usr/local' is the suggested choice.
# Users of FERRET should include the command
#  `. /usr/local/ferret_paths'
# (or wherever you have located the ferret_paths file) in their .login file.
#
# The environment variable FER_DIR should be the pathname of
# the directory named `ferret' you created to install the FERRET software.

# You may want to customize the pathname of the `ferret' directory:
   export FER_DIR=/usr/local/ferret

# The environment variable FER_DSETS should be the pathname of
# the directory named `fer_dsets' you created to install the FERRET program.


# If you set a different directory for the datasets, then un-comment and
# customize the following line, instead of what follows:
#    export FER_DSETS=/my_big_data_disk/fer_dsets

# This directory will contain FERRET demonstration data files (30+ Mbytes)
   export FER_DSETS="$FER_DIR/fer_dsets"


# System Manager: Check this PATH modification for your system security.
# If you prefer not to modify PATH here you may comment out the following few
# lines and execute the file $FER_DIR/bin/install_ferret_links wich will
# create ferret links in /usr/local/bin.
# This logic will replace any previous $FER_DIR in PATH so this
# file may be sourced repeatedly in a single session
