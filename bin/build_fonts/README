README file for the directory build_fonts

Ansley Manke 1/21/2009.

These are the files needed to build the Ferret fonts. 
They were copied from 
/home/porter2/davison/ppld/f1_2/source/fonts

In that directory were subdirectories /vms  and /unix.
These directories are saved under /original, and the 
/unix directory is modified for simplicity and completeness,
renaming the input files to in_fnt01a.chr, ... and changing 
the Makefile so it directly makes the binary font files with
the names that Ferret expects to find.

Also added clean and install targets.

If the environmnent variable PLOTFONTS is defined, then the 
install target installs the files where Ferret will find them.

   make		  Builds and run the program to write the binary font files

   make install	  Copies the files to the directory indicated by PLOTFONTS

   make clean     Removes the executable and the binary font files.
